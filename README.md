Software development or other creative work are in yet another turning point.
Project Builder aims to study software (or other) engineering
process and build software (or other) systems with LLM (large language model) AI assistants
in a structural, verifiable, testable, reproducible, bottom-up architecture and procedures.

In short, software building is moving towards the generative age.
Instead of written and debugged by engineers line by line, software building
can now be dictated by a human being in prompts, in natural language.
However this revolutionary new process brings in new problems and issues that
we the humans need to solve before LLM can be reliably used to build a software system,
beyond a toy example or simply from a boiler template.


## Introduction
Anyone software developer can attest to a singular fact in their career that
there is always new things to learn, a new language, library, SDK,
environment, system, architectural design, paradigm, platform, engineering, process, hardware,
best practices, or even culture.

Humans have been build software or programs in various manners or paradigms in history
- Hard-wired
- Machine code
- Assembly language
- High level language
    - Produral
    - Functional
    - Object-Oriented
    - Logical

Now we have come into the generative age, a new paradigm, that humans do not need
to labor through line after line of code. Instead, a human can
call up a LLM assistant, like the Star Trek computer, and generate
a creative work, such as a program by dictating prompts.
